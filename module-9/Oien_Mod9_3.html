    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>I was born and raised in <span id="Vancouver">_________</span>, Washington. I am blessed with 2 older brothers and 1 younger brother. I had 2 childhood pets. A dog named <span id="Diego">_________</span>, who is still with us, but is losing his energy more and more each day. I also had a cat named <span id="Licorice">_________</span>. He disappeared one day and we never did find out what happened to that cat.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>I was practically raised on a baseball field. My dad was my coach every year of little league and every other year I was able to play an age level up to compete on my brothers team.<span class="sentence"> My all time favorite baseball memory was the time I hit a <span id="grand_slam">_________</span> and pitched a perfect game in the same game.</span></p>
    
    <p>After tearing my <span id="labrum">_________</span> in my shoulder and my <span id="UCL">_________</span> in my elbow, I can no longer compete on the field. However, I still love to sit down and watch the <span id="Seattle_Mariners">_________</span> play. The Mariners have been my favorite team since I was young. When I was 5, I was hit directly in the head by a <span id="foul_ball">_________</span>. I got that ball signed by the player who hit it and I still have that ball years later.</p>
    
    <p>Other hobbies of mine are <span id="snowboarding">_________</span> and <span id="skateboarding">_________</span>. I'm lucky if I make it through the summer without a sprained ankle or wrist from the skatepark. While <span id="snowboarding">_________</span> is much more forgiving, <span id="skateboarding">_________</span> is much more rewarding when you land a trick that you have spent days or months trying to learn.</p>
